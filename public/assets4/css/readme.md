To use scss compiler we use npm and gulp

# steps:
1. make sure you have npm installed in your computer. If not then you must install it from here https://nodejs.org/en/. Please choose LTS version.
2. run console from theme folder and type `npm install`. That command will install needed node packages to compile scss.
3. run 'gulp watch' to automatically compile when any changes saved.
4. or run 'gulp process-css' to compile scss to css manually.
